			<p>
			Oh, hello there. My name is Meg. I am 31 years old, born and raised in Kansas City, Missouri. I have a 9 year old daughter, who is one of the most funny people I have ever met. We have two cats, Benedict Caterbatch (We were watching a lot of Sherlock at the time) and Orangamo (No answer for this, hes just orange). 
			</p>
			<p>
			I have had just about every job KC has had to offer. Starting with a projectionist for Cinemark in my teen years, to coding for Sprints cable phone lines, to waitressing, to administration, to assembly line work at the Ford plant and running one of KC's busiest brunch spots. Although I did well at all of these professions, I have always gotten bored. I have been working for a tech start-up for almost a year now, and the developers there have really inspired me to presue my interest in coding. It hasn't been long at all, but bordem is definately not something I have felt on this emotional rollercoaster.
